# Classification for Number Image

In this project, we introduced a classification example for number images.  

Here we have some images like this![sample](sample.png)

They are similar to Google CAPTCHAs. 

There are totally 1200 images in folder 'imagedata', and ground truth in file 'labels.txt'.

The task is to make a function called my_classifier.m that decodes three  digits in an image. 

## Run

1. New a folder named ‘labeledImage’ and run ‘DeNoise.m’
2. New a folder named ‘SplitLabeledImage’ with 3 sub-folders named ‘0’, ‘1’ and ‘2’, then run ‘Split.m’
3. Run ‘trainer.m’ to get trained network ‘net.mat’
4. Run ‘evaluate_classifier.m’

## How does it work

// TODO
